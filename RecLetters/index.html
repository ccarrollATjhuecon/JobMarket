      <li

<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >  All of these methods require that your recommenders send PDFs of their letters
to <a

class="ectt-1200">jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu</span></a>.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-1013f1"></a>  
However, you should NOT ask them to send their letters until you have done the things that
YOU are supposed to do (detailed below).
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >  Note that these options do NOT include a method of getting letters to any employer that
has set up its own database system and wants recommenders and/or students to register for a
username, password, etc. In practice, such places will invariably accept letters sent by email to
some department staﬀ person, and that is what we will do. YOU need to ﬁnd out
the email address of that staﬀ person. If there are any employers that absolutely
insist that applicants and recommenders learn to use their own unique systems,
letters to those employers will be completed only AFTER ALL OTHER LETTERS
FOR ALL OTHER STUDENTS have been sent using the preferred methods listed
above. This is vitally important because from past experience we know that the
confusion and delays caused by proprietary systems have the potential to end up making
everyone’s letters late, so we can do this only once that risk has been eliminated. The
only exception to this rule is the IMF, which has its own procedures that we do
follow.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >  Some employers have a deadline before Nov 15 (a few as early as Nov 1). Most employers
have deadlines in middle to late November. Finally, employers with late job postings may
appear in the December JOE.
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >  For each timeframe, you will send to <a 
href="mailto:jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu</span></a> a list of employers to
which you are applying: <span 
class="ectt-1200">Employers[Moniker]</span>-<span 
class="ectt-1200">[Which]</span> where “Which” will be the words
“Early,” “Middle”, or “Late.” There should be at least a week between the date when you send
the spreadsheet and the earliest application due-date contained therein. Thus, if
you want to apply to some jobs that have a deadline of Nov 1, then by October 23
you would send <span 
class="ectt-1200">Employers[Moniker]</span>-<span 
class="ectt-1200">Early</span>. It would be good to include also in
the “Early” spreadsheet employers with a deadline up to Nov 15 or 16, so that the
workload is spread out over time as much as possible. By Nov 8 you would send
<span 
class="ectt-1200">Employers[Moniker]</span>-<span 
class="ectt-1200">Mid</span> with the employers who have November deadlines that you did
not send in your “Early” spreadsheet. Finally, if any new jobs are posted in the
December JOE that you want to apply to, then sometime around Dec 7 you would send
<span 
class="ectt-1200">Employers[Moniker]</span>-<span 
class="ectt-1200">Late</span>. (It is good to include as many employers as possible in your
“Late” spreadsheet because this spreads out the work that <a 
href="https://github.com/ccarrollATjhuecon/JobMarket/blob/main/Notation" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">JMStaff</span></a> has to do more evenly
over time).
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >  You will get these 3 (and ONLY these 3) opportunities to apply to jobs. It is impossible for
the staﬀ, for every student, to keep track of more than 3 spreadsheets each of which has
multiple employers; experience tells us that everything breaks down if every few days each
student drops by the oﬃce (or sends an email) saying “oh by the way, please add the following
4 employers to my list.”
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >  Broadly, for each iteration your steps are as follows:
      <ol  class="enumerate1" >
