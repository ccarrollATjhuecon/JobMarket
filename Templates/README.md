# Template documents are in the appropriate locations:

## [OneDrive/templates/Moniker](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/econplacement_jh_edu/EuLpAiLBlKxJiA681OAjMiIBsImAqRMYuu-HKEIX0-t1Lw?e=dqQIV3)

This is where you will find templates for the items that you need to put in your own OneDrive folder,
replacing the "Moniker" in the filename with your actual Moniker. So, like, if I were on the market,
I would have a file named `EmployersCarrollCD.xlsx` -- NOT `EmployersMonikerCarrollDC.xlsx`.

  * [EmployersMoniker](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Steps/#employers-lists)
    - [`EmployersMoniker.xlsm`](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/econplacement_jh_edu/EUXOP3uK5X9EgqUy8v72KgIBi8Bgy5dv53-QYnGkj9ttag?e=hmPSaY)
  * [InterviewsMoniker] - to keep track of interviews
    - [`InterviewsMoniker.xlsx`](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/econplacement_jh_edu/EuLpAiLBlKxJiA681OAjMiIBqdYrJrfcAUQxarLFe4pU7A?e=fPOwyf)
  * MemoMoniker - send a link of this to the JMPO and your advisors when it is posted
    - [`MemoMoniker.tex`](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/econplacement_jh_edu/EbKwIYCn44dMjpQTictKWboBXUjz8b0iQMTB-c5yPjdGgQ?e=QMQZQu)
  * SpielsMoniker - Your spiels
    - [`SpielsMoniker.tex`](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/econplacement_jh_edu/ET8ilNbW1ktEnj8bsDUedXQBDu0GjU-CAjtPEofvvIxx5Q?e=k73yrt)
  
Because your cover letters need to use your EmployersMoniker spreadsheets, it is also where our template for creating cover letters is:

  * CreateCoverLetters
    - [`CreateCoverLetters.doc`](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/econplacement_jh_edu/EftNCyjLEctGgnYk2V9J-yoBmJ7Sx3VXfKi1_rZJA-hdtg?e=igNoIl)

## [JobMarket-Templates](https://github.com/ccarrollATjhuecon/JobMarket-Templates)

  * Templates for public-facing documents (CV, JobPaper, Abstract, etc)
     * Make a **fork** of this GitHub repo (google if you don't understand)
     * Clone your fork to your local machine (google is your friend)
	 * Make and checkout a **branch** named after your moniker
	 * Personalize the documents on your computer
  * Documents generated by the templates go into your `moniker-dir`
  * `moniker-dir` should be the source for your `online files`
  
## [`online-files`](https://github.com/ccarrollATjhuecon/JobMarket/blob/main/JobMarketProceduresHelp.md) posted to JHU Econ server

This is where the web page looks for your job market materials, like CV and abstract etc.

  * Generated by customizing the materials in **JobMarket-Templates** as above
  * Once you have generated your personalized versions:
     * Mount the remote drive to the directorry named after your Moniker
	 * Copy all the materials from your `moniker-dir` to the mounted folder
