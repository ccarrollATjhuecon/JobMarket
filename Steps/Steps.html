      value because each person has only two of them. Though you should not obsess
      about where to send your “signals” you should give it some thought – if you are a
      plausible candidate for a job at the institution in question, they will deﬁnitely pay
      more attention to your application if they receive your “signal.” It will single out
      your application from the 400 others they will have received. They might receive
      only 10 “signals” so they can aﬀord to pay close attention to those applications.

<!--l. 200--><p class="indent" >  You will ultimately need to generate form-letters to the employers you plan to apply to, and
will need various kinds of information about them (like email addresses and phone numbers)
as you work your way through the process. Over the years, we have developed a standardized
Excel spreadsheet template that contains slots for all the information you will need to collect,
available in the https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Templates folder as
<span 
class="ectt-1200">EmployersMoniker.xlsm</span>. You <span 
class="ecti-1200">MUST </span>use (a renamed version of) this Excel spreadsheet
template when you send out your applications (because you want to use the linked
form-letter-generating software); therefore, to avoid confusing yourself by having multiple lists,
you should start your process by downloading the spreadsheet <a 
href="https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Templates/" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">EmployersMoniker.xlsm</span></a> from
the https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Templates directory. Rename it to, e.g.,
<span 
class="ectt-1200">EmployersCarrollCD.xlsm</span>, erase the information that is in it (unless you want to apply to
some of the example employers included in the template ﬁle – in which case, you still need to
verify that they are hiring this year and the contact information has remained the same). <span 
class="ecti-1200">DO</span>
<span 
class="ecti-1200">NOT </span>rearrange or rename the columns in this template – in the end, the JMPO will need to
merge all of the students’ templates in order to have a manageable idea of who has applied
where, and you do not want to annoy the JMPO at this crucial time by making extra
work in the form of ﬁguring out what you have renamed columns to and where you
have moved them to. (You are welcome to add extra columns beyond those in the
template, and hide those that you don’t need to use; but do NOT rename or reorder
them!).

href="https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/TimeTable" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">TimeTable</span></a> you should have developed a list of most of the places
to which you wish to apply. At that point, make an appointment with your advisor(s) to
discuss the list. When you and your advisor(s) have agreed on the list, you will need to give
copies of the list to the people who are writing reference letters. See <a 
href="https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/RecLetters" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">RecLetters</span></a> for
procedures. For academic employers, some will ask for evidence of teaching skills;
here, there is no clear-cut standard for what they expect to receive, but student
evaluations of your performance (including a few choice quotes from the student
evaluation forms) are a good idea. Do NOT send more than a page or two of info on
this subject - nobody will read more than this, so distill everything down to the
essence.

<!--l. 216--><p class="noindent" >One more point: You should have a regular computer backup plan (ideally, an automatic
backup every night; at a minimum, once a week) for ALL the materials that are critical to
your thesis research, job market paper, and application process. Without a backup, you are at
risk of losing months worth of work or more, and in a worst case scenario it could mean you
will have to withdraw from the job market. In 2003 one student’s laptop crashed right in the
middle of the job market. Fortunately the student had a week-old backup of the key ﬁles; but
let that be a warning.
