           attention to if you are particularly interested in a job in the region in
           question. For example, over the years there have been several eﬀorts to
           produce a European job market patterned on the US market. Recently
           (I  think  starting  in  2017)  a  new  eﬀort  by  the  <a 
href="https://www.eeassoc.org/" >European  Economic
           Association</a> has been launched, which seems to have learned some lessons
           from  past  eﬀorts.  Some  European  institutions  (universities;  central
           banks)  have  said  they  have  switched  their  recruiting  eﬀorts  to  the
           European  from  the  American  market.  Some  institutions  are  treating
           participation in this market as a screening device: Anyone at the ASSA
           meetings can say they’d be delighted to have a job in Europe when a
           European institution interviews them, but then when they have oﬀers
           from comparably ranked American institutions they tend to go to the
           American  employer.  Flying  all  the  way  to  Europe  is  a  costly  and
           time-consuming thing to do, and for PhD candidates both money and
           time are at a premium. So if you do participate in the European market,
           that does signiﬁcantly increase your odds of getting a job oﬀer from a
           European institution, compared to your odds if you were to interview
           with  the  same  institution  only  at  the  ASSA  meetings  in  the  US.  A
           potential strategy here is to apply to jobs at European institutions and
           see if you get invited to an interview. If you have no interview requests at
           institutions you might be willing to take a job from, you can cancel any
           plans you have made to go to Europe. Alternatively, if your job market
           prospects in the US market are not looking very favorable, it might be
           worth sending a costly signal to European institutions by going to the
           European market.

           You  generally  meet  individually  with  faculty  at  a  ﬂy-out.  Usually  a

           Occasionally, at big schools, you might meet with groups of a few faculty
           (so that everyone has a chance to meet you). The conversations are
           generally more relaxed and informal than the interviews at the meetings,
           and also more wide-ranging. This is where it really pays oﬀ to be an avid
           reader of the <span

           those people each get 25 oﬀers. The 22 places that have no chance of
           hiring them (along with the 3 who do have a chance) then wait for a
           month until they learn the candidate has turned them down. They then
           make an oﬀer to a person they think is another superstar, and wait for
           that person to select among their many oﬀers. Then, in March, they get
           realistic and start making oﬀers to people they might actually be able
           to hire. So if you don’t have any job oﬀers by Feb 15, don’t worry. (But
