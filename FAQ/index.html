           attention to if you are particularly interested in a job in the region in
           question. For example, over the years there have been several eﬀorts to
           produce a European job market patterned on the US market. Starting
           in 2018 a new eﬀort by the <a 
href="https://www.eeassoc.org/" >European Economic Association</a> has been
           launched, which seems to have learned some lessons from (failed) past
           eﬀorts to create a thick matching market for European institutions hiring
           economists.  Some  European  institutions  (universities;  central  banks)
           have said they have switched their recruiting eﬀorts to the European
           from the American market. In order to participate in the European job
           market you must get a EEA membership and register <a 
href="https://www.europeanjobmarketofeconomists.org/" >here</a>. The problem
           is that anyone can say in a Zoom interview they’d be delighted to have
           a job in Europe when a European institution interviews them, but then
           when they have oﬀers from comparably ranked American institutions
           they tend to go to the American employer. If you want to send a costly
           signal that you are really interested in jobs in Europe, you might consider
           ﬂying to Europe for the EEA meetings (typically in late August), and
           try while there to contact institutions that have already advertised an
           available position.

           suﬃce. Again, some examples are in <a

           particular things. So in practice, there is very little real issue of “student
           rivalry”  in the sense of worrying about whether other JHU students
           are your competitors for a given job, or whether the placement director
           might tilt the playing ﬁeld somehow; in my (many) years as a placement
           director I have never seen a case where two JHU students were actually
           close substitutes for a given match. As a result, my incentives are almost
           perfectly aligned with the students’ incentives, in the sense that my job
           performance is measured by how well JHU students do on the market,
           and my incentive is to help ﬁnd the right matches.
