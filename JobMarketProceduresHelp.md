# Job Market Procedures

## Updating Job Market Candidates' Folders

### Introduction

The "Job Market Computer Coordinator" or [web liaision](http://econ.jhu.edu/directoryindex/staff/) will set up a simple web folder for each job market candidate.  
For these instructions, assume that your name is "Firstname Middlename Lastname". The address of your individual web folder will be at:

___

http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/jobmarket/year/LastnameFM

___


where "LastnameFM" is your [Moniker](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation).

You are responsible for updating the contents of your folder. Your folder contains the following sub-folders: 

-   Abstract
-   CV
-   JobPaper
-   JobTalk
-   NonThesisPapers
-   OtherThesisPapers

and a template.txt file, where you will add information for your personal page. There are also relevant templates for your CV, abstracts, etc.... in the sub-folders. The individual webpages are linked to the [Job Market Candidates web page](http://econ.jhu.edu/directoryindex/job-market/). You can view sample pages at [http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/jobmarket/2016/RondaV/](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/jobmarket/2016/RondaV/) and [http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/jobmarket/2016/DengL/](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/jobmarket/2016/DengL/)

### Uploading and Updating

#### Uploading

In order to make sure that no links on your job market page are dead, you need to follow a naming convention. All of your links must end in the following way:

___

"http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/jobmarket/year/LastnameFM/JobPaper/JobPaperLastnameFM.pdf".

___

For example, suppose your CV is ready. Name your CV "CVLastnameFM" so that the link to your CV will be:

___

"http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/jobmarket/year/LastnameFM/CV/CVLastnameFM.pdf".

___


If, for example, you have a JPE paper as your other thesis paper. Name this paper "JPELastnameFM" and its link will be:

___

"http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/jobmarket/year/LastnameFM/NonThesisPapers/JPELastnameFM.pdf".

___

#### Updating

When you need to update files in your folder:

* **IMPORTANT!!!**  When updating files **MAKE SURE that you do not change the name of the file** or copy the files to a different folder; just replace the existing file with the updated one. This ensures that the links on your job market web page work.
-   When updating PDF files generated by LaTeX .tex files, **REPLACE BOTH the .tex and .pdf files.** After you update these files, email the [web liaison](http://econ.jhu.edu/directoryindex/staff/).

When you need to update your personal page:

-   Update your template.txt file and email the [web liaision](http://econ.jhu.edu/directoryindex/staff/) the corresponding changes. **Be CLEAR** about what changes you made, as all changes are updated manually by the [web liaision](http://econ.jhu.edu/directoryindex/staff/).

### Miscellaneous

If you need to connect to the folders from off-campus please follow the instructions (you will need to replace the generic path in these instructions with the path given above) posted at:
[http://econ.jhu.edu/research-programs/research-resources/computing-resources/econlab-computing-procedures/#remote](http://econ.jhu.edu/research-programs/research-resources/computing-resources/econlab-computing-procedures/#remote)

Instructions for connecting from a Mac are available at:
[http://econ.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/Documentation/MacOSXMapaNetworkDrive.pdf](http://econ.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/Documentation/MacOSXMapaNetworkDrive.pdf)
Depending on the OS you are using your screens may be slightly different.

If you encounter difficulties creating and/or maintaining your jobmarket folder contents, do not hesitate to contact the [web liaision](http://econ.jhu.edu/directoryindex/staff/).


### Instructions for Reference Letters

___

Below is information about each of the main methods for causing your recommendation letters to be sent to employers to whom you have applied.

## [EJM](http://econjobmarket.org/ "EconJobMarket") Instructions

### General Procedure

Information can be found at [RecLetters](https://github.com/ccarrollATjhuecon/JobMarket/RecLetters/). This service will be provided for JHU Economics professors and any outside reference letter writers who are willing to name [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation) as their proxy to upload letters.

### Multiple Letters

Typically when a main/generic reference is uploaded, it will be automatically submitted to all employers/schools.

Things are a bit more complicated when needs multiple types of letters from the same letter writer (most commonly academic and non-academic references).

We handle this problem using two alternative procedures:

##### Semi-Auto Solution:

We will upload a main/generic reference which will be automatically submitted to all employers/schools. We then withdraw this reference from the non-academic institutions. You are responsible for letting [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation) know which non-academic institutions you have applied to, so that the wrong reference is withdrawn and replaced with the correct one[\[1\]](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/jobmarket/Information/JobMarketProceduresHelp.html#footnote-1).

If you only have one generic letter from a faculty member, that is the letter that will be uploaded and sent out automatically. If you need another type of reference letter (non-academic, research, teaching) sent out, you are responsible for letting [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation) know which type of letter needs to uploaded to what site and to which places you are applying. You will convey this type of information on each spreadsheet that will be emailed to [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation).

##### Manual Solution:

For the students:

-   Let the staff know beforehand, or as soon as possible, that you are going to use EJM for academic as well as non-academic applications **AND** that you will be getting more than one recommendation letter from one or more recommenders. Supply the names of the recomenders with multiple letters.
-   Provide a spreadsheet stating which institutions will receive each kind of reference letter.

For staff:

-   For students who will receive **ONLY ONE** recommendation letter from each recommender use the "Submit Letter for Automatic Delivery" option and upload a "Default letter" for each recommender.
-   For students who will receive more than one recommendation letter per recommender **DO NOT** use the "Submit Letter for Automatic Delivery" option. Instead click on the "show applications" link. Use the "submit letter" link to submit the appropriate letter for each institution.
-   In case you used the "Default letter" option for a candidate and later they received more than one letter of recommendation per recommender choose the "Disable Automatic Delivery" option for that particular recommender. Click on "show applications". Choose the "update letter" option and replace the submitted default letter with the new one for each institution according to the spreadsheet provided by the candidates.

1\. Note that the possibility of the employers getting both, or the wrong kind of reference is almost non existent because of the way EJM works. References are not actually sent to the employers - the employer checks EJM and either reviews it online or downloads the materials at some point - most likely after the application deadline.

## [Interfolio](https://www.interfolio.com/ "Interfolio") Instructions

Instructions for using Interfolio for letters of recommendation:

1.  Indicate that you are going to use Interfolio in your spreadsheets (AppSubmitMethod, RecLetterSendGroup).
2.  Wait for an email from [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation) indicating that she has received ALL your letters of recommendation. [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation) will tell you if you have multiple letters of recommendation from a specific faculty member as well as the type of recommendation (E.g. generic, academic, non-academic, etc...). **DO NOT PROCEED** with the recommendation requests if you don't know the type of recommendation letter you are getting from each specific faculty member.
3.  When entering the recommendation requests in Interfolio please make sure to:
a. Start the recommendation request by going to "Letters" in the left menu bar.
b. Enter the name of your recommender as [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation) \JMStaffNameLast and econ@jhu.edu as her e-mail for each recommendation request. You need to do this as many times as the number of recommendation letters you are expecting to have.
c. For each recommendation request, specify under "Document Title" the recommender’s actual name (e.g. Dr. Laurence Ball) and the type of the recommendation letter (generic, academic, non-academic. etc.) per [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation)'s e-mail.
_For example, if [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation) emailed you that Professor Ball wrote you both academic and non-academic letters of recommendation, one of your document titles would be: **Dr. Laurence Ball\_non-academic recommendation** and another would be **Dr. Laurence Ball\_academic recommendation.**_
d. "Description" - leave blank.
e. "Message to Recommender" - leave as is.
f. Under "Recommendation Type" there are two choices - General and Specific position. Only choose **"Specific position"** and enter the recommender actual name along with the type of the reference letter (generic, academic, non-academic. etc...).
_For example: **Dr. Laurence Ball\_non-academic recommendation**_
g. "Due date" - this is irrelevant, just choose a date a few days ahead. Your actual deadlines are already included in the spreadsheets sent to [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation).

All Interfolio reference letters will be uploaded to Interfolio directly by [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation), including the ones from external recommenders.

## AcademicJobsOnline - AJO

Instructions for using AcademicJobsOnline:

After all reference letters for each student are received, [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation) will make 1 PDF file of all letters and upload their file to the AJO site. The student will be allowed to see when this upload is complete. For example: Prof x - Prof y and Prof z (3 generic ref letters) This service will be provided for JHU Economics Professors and external reference writers.

## American Economic Association - AEA

Instructions for using American Economic Association:

Students who are using AEA must inform their JHU Economics Department reference writer to go to [www.aeaweb.org](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/jobmarket/Information/www.aeaweb.org) and set up a surrogate for their reference letters. The surrogate name is [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation). This service will be provided for JHU Economics professors and external reference writers if they are willing to name [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation) as a surrogate.

## Federal Reserve

Instructions for Federal Reserve:

Students will give [jmstaff-jhuecon@jhu.edu](https://ccarrollATjhuecon.github.io/JobMarket/Notation) their file naming requirements for their letters which they will obtain directly from the Federal Reserve. For example: 576024\_233025\_JonathanWright.
