# Fall Jamboree

-   Share student preferences (job type; location; coordination problems)

-   Students learn from each other

-   Faculty learn about students (esp not in their fields)

-   Faculty react the way actual job market audiences might

    -   Key: get reactions from out-of-field faculty
